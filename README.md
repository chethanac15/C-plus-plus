This repository contains a collection of C++ code, ranging from basic to intermediate level examples. It is designed to help learners understand and practice fundamental concepts of C++ programming. The repository includes:

Basic Syntax and Structure: Examples of simple C++ programs, including "Hello, World!" and basic input/output operations.

Variables and Data Types: Demonstrations of different data types, variable declarations, and initializations.

Control Structures: Code snippets illustrating the use of if-else statements, switch cases, loops (for, while, do-while), and conditional operators.

Functions: Examples of defining and calling functions, including parameter passing (by value and by reference) and return types.

Arrays and Strings: Basic operations on arrays and strings, including initialization, iteration, and common manipulations.

Pointers and References: Introduction to pointers, pointer arithmetic, and references.

Object-Oriented Programming: Basic concepts of OOP, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

File Handling: Simple programs for reading from and writing to files.

Standard Template Library (STL): Examples of using STL containers (like vectors, lists, and maps) and algorithms.

This repository serves as a practical guide for beginners to build a strong foundation in C++ programming. Each section is well-documented, with comments explaining the code for better understanding

Happy coding
